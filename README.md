# Minecraft Datapack Installer
I'm making a command line tool that allows you to install minecraft datapacks into the currently open minecraft world.
Think something like pip for minecraft datapacks.

See this repository for the Datapack Index that this tool will pull from: https://github.com/Nicolas-Gatien/MCD-Index
